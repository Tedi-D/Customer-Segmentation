# Customer-Segmentation

📊 Prism Customer Segmentation Dashboard
This Power BI dashboard was designed to explore and visualize user segments for Prism, a fictional membership-based platform. The goal was to develop actionable segmentation to inform targeted marketing and engagement strategies.

🔍 Overview
The dashboard provides a high-level analysis of Prism’s member base, focusing on:
- Customer Segments ranked 1 (Trendy) to 7 (Lost Causes)
- Member distribution by gender, plus tier, city, and traffic source
- Dynamic filters to refine insights by registration and purchase dates

📌 Features
- Bar charts visualize user segmentation and gender split
- Pie charts offer a snapshot of tier distribution, city concentration, and traffic acquisition
- Interactive filters allow stakeholders to drill into specific customer groups
- Designed with stakeholder clarity in mind—ensuring accessible, visual narratives

🛠 Tools Used
- Power BI for data visualization
- DAX for custom logic
- Placeholder data to simulate real-world engagement metrics

✨ What I’d Do Differently
If involved in a live project like this, I’d likely spend more time balancing exhaustiveness and clarity in the segmentation model. While seven distinct customer groups allow for detailed targeting, fewer, more strategically defined segments might improve actionability and clarity for stakeholders without compromising depth. The goal would be to deliver insights that are both comprehensive and intuitive.

📈 Future Improvements
- Add segmentation metrics by purchase frequency and AOV
- Connect to a real-time data source for live updates
- Incorporate behavioral data like click paths or dwell time
