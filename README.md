📊 Prism Customer Segmentation Dashboard 

This Power BI dashboard was designed to segment Prism's user base and help stakeholders make smarter, more targeted decisions. Spanning customer profiles and behavioral trends, the report surfaces where different users engage—and where real value lies.

🔍 Overview

The dashboard provides a high-level analysis of Prism’s member base, focusing on:
- Customer Segments ranked 1 (Trendy) to 7 (Lost Causes)
- Member distribution by gender, plus tier, city, and traffic source
- Dynamic filters to refine insights by registration and purchase date

It’s built for quick audience profiling - answering who our users are, where they’re coming from, and how they’re distributed across key variables. The filters also enable slicing by registration and purchase periods to spot acquisition waves or seasonal shifts.

📈 Segment Behavior Overview
Highlighting each segment’s behaviour:
- Total Orders
- Return Volume
- Average Order Value (AOV)
  
It challenges surface-level assumptions. Some “quiet” segments deliver more per purchase; others generate volume but drag performance down with high returns. The result is a behavioral X-ray: who’s worth nurturing, and who’s costing more than they contribute.

✨ Reflection

If working on a similar project again, I’d invest more time streamlining the segment model with fewer categories, still exhaustive, but easier for teams to act on. The current segments give nuance, but a tighter set might sharpen decision-making, especially when aligning with marketing or product management teams. I’d also co-design with stakeholders to ensure each group reflects strategic meaning beyond the numbers.
